This README applies to the remote (e.g. GitHub) version of this repository.

This repository shows sample scripts that I wrote over the years to administer my own computers.

I include mostly Python 3 and bash script while leaving other files out to keep the repository clean.

While browsing the code you may notice some things look funny or refer to something invalid because I cleaned the files of any sensitive data and excluded files as mentioned.

I also reset the commit history each time I push to this repository, so everything will appear new. I began to write these files in 2017 and incrementally update them.

In the meantime, enjoy the code!
